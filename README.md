## Pacman Game

This repo includes a simple Pacman implementation using `pygame`.

### Running the Game

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python pacman.py
   ```

Use the arrow keys to move Pacman. Collect pellets to earn points and avoid the ghost.
